      <p>
        After the whirlwind of Day 1, I was eager to get to grips with the
        specifics of coding, and HTML seemed like the natural starting point. As
        a beginner, it was exciting to imagine all the possibilities of what I
        could create — websites, forms, and layouts — just by understanding the
        building blocks of HTML. Armed with a cheat sheet I'd created and the
        resources I'd found, I dove straight into the world of HTML.
      </p>

      <h3>Choosing My Resources</h3>
      <p>
        To begin, I turned to resources like
        <a href="https://roadmap.sh/">Roadmap.sh</a> and a comprehensive YouTube
        video that walked through the basics of HTML. Roadmap.sh provided a
        clear structure, outlining what I needed to focus on, while the video
        helped break things down into manageable sections. Together, these
        resources were helpful, but despite having such clear guidance,
        something still didn't feel quite right.
      </p>

      <h3>Building My Cheat Sheet</h3>
      <p>
        To help reinforce my learning, I created a cheat sheet. I wrote down all
        the tags, attributes, and a few examples of how to use them. Writing it
        all out was useful, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I wasn't
        really learning. I had memorised the syntax, sure, but the concepts
        didn't feel ingrained. I wasn't confident in my ability to apply what
        I'd learned in real-world scenarios.
      </p>

      <h3>The Frustration of "Following Along"</h3>
      <p>
        At this point, I realised a major challenge of learning to code:
        <strong>passive learning</strong>. Just watching or copying code without
        actively engaging with it doesn't lead to true understanding. It felt
        like I was just going through the motions, hoping it would click
        eventually. I needed to break away from this passive approach if I
        wanted to move forward.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <p>By the end of Day 2, I had learned some important lessons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Passive learning isn't enough:</strong> Watching tutorials and
          following along is helpful, but true learning comes from engaging with
          the material. Trying to build your own projects, even if they're
          simple, is one of the best ways to reinforce your understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >Cheat sheets are useful, but not a substitute for
            understanding:</strong
          >
          Having a reference guide is great when you need it, but it's the
          context and reasoning behind each tag and attribute that matter most.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        Although Day 2 was filled with frustration and doubt at times, it was
        also the day I began to truly understand the basics of HTML. It wasn't
        about memorising code — it was about applying it and seeing how it fits
        together. I still have a lot to learn, but the foundation is now in
        place, and I'm starting to feel more comfortable with the language.
