      <p>
        After gaining a solid grounding in HTML over the past couple of days, I
        was ready to take the next step in my coding journey. My curiosity led
        me to Codecademy, a popular platform for learning coding interactively.
        The site offered a structured way to learn, with a combination of
        theory, exercises, and quizzes. I thought it would be the perfect
        resource to continue building on my HTML knowledge. However, as I spent
        more time working through the lessons, I started to feel like I was
        getting stuck in something I had heard a lot about — "tutorial hell."
      </p>

      <h3>The Allure of Codecademy</h3>
      <p>
        When I first logged into Codecademy, I was impressed by its organised
        structure and user-friendly design. The interactive lessons helped me
        grasp the basic concepts quickly. I was introduced to new elements of
        HTML and CSS, including more advanced topics like classes, IDs, and the
        structure of a webpage. The exercises were great for reinforcing the
        theory, and I felt like I was learning more about how different tags and
        styles worked together.
      </p>

      <h3>Falling into the Trap of Tutorial Hell</h3>
      <p>
        I soon realised that I had fallen into what many developers call
        "tutorial hell." This term refers to the frustrating cycle where you
        constantly follow tutorials and exercises without ever going beyond
        them. It's easy to get stuck in a loop of completing tutorial after
        tutorial, but without applying the knowledge to real projects, you
        aren't truly learning.
      </p>

      <h3>The Need for Guided Projects</h3>
      <p>
        It became clear to me that what I needed was a guided project —
        something that would teach me the basics but then challenge me to go off
        on my own and solve problems independently. The idea of working through
        a project where I could apply my knowledge, test my skills, and confront
        my weaknesses sounded like the perfect solution.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Tutorials are useful, but they aren't enough:</strong>
          It's easy to get caught up in the comfort of following step-by-step
          instructions. While tutorials can teach you syntax and basic
          principles, real learning happens when you apply your knowledge to
          solve problems on your own.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Guided projects offer the right balance:</strong>
          The best way to move forward is by finding projects that provide a bit
          of structure but also challenge you to think critically and work
          independently. A guided project can help you build confidence and
          reinforce what you've learned.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning is messy:</strong>
          It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking that learning is a smooth,
          linear process. But in reality, it's full of trial and error. The more
          I struggled through challenges and mistakes, the more I began to
          understand how things worked.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The importance of independence:</strong>
          The real learning comes when you stop relying on others to tell you
          what to do and start figuring things out yourself. It's through this
          process of problem-solving that you begin to internalise the skills
          you need.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        Day 3 was a wake-up call. While Codecademy offered a lot of useful
        information, it wasn't enough to build the skills I needed to truly move
        forward. I'm now more focused on working through projects that allow me
        to apply my knowledge, even if they involve some trial and error. I'm
        looking for projects that give me the basics and then let me go off on
        my own, face challenges, and work through my mistakes.
