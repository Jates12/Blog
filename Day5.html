      <p>
        Day 5 was a major turning point in my coding journey — it was the day I
        finally took off the training wheels and created my first
        <strong>solo projects</strong>. Up until now, I had been following along
        with tutorials, completing exercises, and recreating websites with some
        guidance. But today, I took everything I had learned and put it into
        practice on my own, with no step-by-step instructions to follow. The
        results? My first personal projects: a <strong>CV website</strong> and
        the <strong>blog you're reading right now</strong>.
      </p>

      <h3>The First Solo Challenge: My Online CV</h3>
      <p>
        I decided to create an online CV for my first project. This was a simple
        and practical way to combine everything I had learned so far — HTML for
        structure, CSS for styling, and a bit of personal flair to make it stand
        out. It wasn't about being fancy; it was about applying the knowledge I
        had gained to build something useful.
      </p>

      <p>
        The best part? I now have a live, online CV that I can show off to
        potential employers or anyone who might want to know more about me. And
        it's hosted on GitHub, which is another big win in itself. I took the
        leap from "just learning" to creating something real and usable — and
        I'm really proud of the result. You can check it out in my
        <a href="https://github.com/Jates12/Online-CV">GitHub repository.</a>
      </p>

      <h3>The Blog - A New Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        Alongside the CV, I decided to create this blog. Writing about my
        journey is not only a way to track my progress, but it's also a project
        that allows me to practice my skills in a slightly different way. A blog
        has a different structure and style compared to a CV, and I was excited
        to build it from scratch, deciding how I wanted it to look and function.
      </p>

      <h3>Learning on My Own: No Training Wheels</h3>
      <p>
        What made Day 5 so special wasn't the fact that I completed two
        projects, but the fact that I did it on my own. For the first time, I
        wasn't relying on tutorials or structured lessons. I had no specific
        guide telling me what to do next. I just started coding, thinking about
        the design, experimenting with different approaches, and figuring out
        what worked. It was incredibly empowering.
      </p>

      <h3>The Buzz of Creating Something of My Own</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most exciting things about today was the feeling of
        accomplishment. As I was working on these projects, I couldn't help but
        feel a sense of pride with each step. The more I built, the more I
        started to understand how all the pieces fit together. It wasn't just
        about coding — it was about problem-solving, creativity, and
        persistence.
      </p>

      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        As I look back at Day 5, I can't help but feel excited for what's to
        come. I've completed my first solo projects, but this is only the
        beginning. The skills I've gained so far are just the foundation, and
        now it's time to build on them. Every project, no matter how simple, is
        another step forward in becoming a better developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking ahead to Day 6 and beyond, I'm ready to take on new challenges,
        experiment with more complex designs, and continue putting everything
        I've learned into practice. The excitement of creating something from
        scratch is what keeps me going, and I can't wait to see what I'll create
        next!
