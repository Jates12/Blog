      <p>
        After a few days of absorbing HTML, CSS, and diving into some helpful
        tutorials, I felt like I was finally ready to put my knowledge to the
        test. Day 4 marked a major milestone in my coding journey: I completed
        my first real project.
      </p>

      <p>
        The project itself came from a YouTube video I watched called
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJgBOIoGihA&t=19s"
          >"How to Build a Website from Scratch (Beginner Tutorial)"</a
        >. The video not only gave me a solid understanding of the steps needed
        to build a website but also provided me with all the materials to get
        started — a basic CSS stylesheet and some reference images. The project
        wasn't overly complex, but it was exactly what I needed to take the next
        step and prove to myself that I could apply everything I had learned so
        far.
      </p>

      <h3>A Solid Foundation and New Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        The video was well-structured and explained the project clearly. It laid
        out the framework, but it didn't hold my hand too much. The tutorial
        didn't walk me through every single line of code. Instead, it focused on
        teaching me how to use the resources (the stylesheet and images) to
        create a simple webpage layout. For the first time, I felt like I was
        really building something from the ground up.
      </p>

      <h3>Building the Project</h3>
      <p>
        With the materials ready and the basic structure in mind, I set off to
        create the project. I opened my text editor, created a new folder for my
        project files, and started working with the HTML and CSS. The first step
        was to structure the page with headings, paragraphs, and images,
        following the reference images provided. These reference images gave me
        a visual guide, but I had to figure out how to get the layout just right
        using the tools I had learned so far.
      </p>

      <h3>Trial and Error: The Path to Success</h3>
      <p>
        The process wasn't smooth. It took a few hours, and I hit roadblocks
        along the way. Some elements didn't align properly, some text was too
        large, and some images looked out of place. But every time I made a
        mistake, I learned how to fix it. Through trial and error, I began to
        understand how HTML and CSS work together to create a webpage.
      </p>

      <h3>What I Learned</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Learning by Doing:</strong>
          This project reinforced that the best way to truly learn is by
          creating something yourself. The theory and exercises are important,
          but the hands-on experience is what truly solidifies the knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trial and Error Is Essential:</strong>
          I encountered a lot of mistakes along the way, but each one was an
          opportunity to learn. By facing challenges head-on, I was able to
          solve problems and improve my skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>CSS Is a Powerful Tool:</strong>
          Even though I've only scratched the surface of CSS, this project
          showed me just how powerful it can be when used effectively. I had to
          dig deeper into CSS properties, and it felt great to begin to
          understand how they can be used to manipulate the layout and design of
          a webpage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Don't Be Afraid to Struggle:</strong>
          This project wasn't easy. There were plenty of times when I felt
          frustrated or confused. But those struggles are an important part of
          the learning process. It's through these challenges that real growth
          happens.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        Day 4 was a pivotal moment in my coding journey. Not only did I complete
        my first project, but I also realised that the true learning begins when
        you start applying your knowledge and problem-solving on your own. While
        the project wasn't perfect, it was a significant milestone — one that
        gave me the confidence to continue moving forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm excited for what comes next. With the foundations in HTML and CSS in
        place, I feel ready to take on bigger projects, experiment with new
        techniques, and keep building my skills. Day 4 taught me that coding is
        about persistence, problem-solving, and, above all, enjoying the process
        of learning and creating.
